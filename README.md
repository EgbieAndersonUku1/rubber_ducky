# Original creator of ducky script file : Skidde
# Creator of DuckyScript 3.0: Egbie
# Author : Egbie
# Version DuckyScript 3.0
# Written in Python 3
# Works only in python 3.x
#
# I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO SKIDDIE THE ORIGINAL
# CREATOR OF UAC-DUCK GENERATOR SCRIPT. MY WORK IS BASED OFF HIS SKIDDIE
# SCRIPT WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED IN PYTHON 2.X. AND WITHOUT HIS WORK IT
# WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ME TO CREATE THIS VERSION.
#
# HIS ORIGINAL SCRIPT CAN BE FOUND AT HIS GITHUB ACCOUNT LOCATED BELOW.
# HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/SKIDDIETECH/UAC-D-E-RUBBER-DUCKY/BLOB/MASTER/UAC-DUCK.PY
#
# I HAVED USED HIS WORK AND RE-WRITTEN IT SO THAT IT CAN NOW BE RUN FOR
# THOSE OF US WHO HAVE PYTHON 3.X.
#
# WELCOME TO THE MAD HOUSE AND LET THE HACKING BEGIN..

This script works pretty much like the original. The only exception is that I have
re-written so it now works in python 3. For a full read on how the script works
check out the original notes produced by Skiddie at his github account.
There is also a demonstration video of the attack as well as how to use the offline mode.
