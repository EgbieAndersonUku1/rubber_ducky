This script works pretty much like the original. The only exception is that I have
re-written so it now works in python 3. For a full read on how the script works
check out the original notes produced by Skiddie at his github account.
There is also a demonstration video as well as how to use the offline mode.
For the orignal script written by skiddie you can found it at his github account
